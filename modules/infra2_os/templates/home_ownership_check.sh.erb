# Managed by Puppet
# Description: puppet helper script to verify if the ownership in /home/* is correct.
# I was unable to find a way to script this inside of Puppet DSL as a one liner.
# The entire point of the script is to ensure that the home directory ownership
# piece in puppet is idempotent.
